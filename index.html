    This algorith is designed to select a random participant from a group by having each participant select a random number. <br>
    This allows for a decentralized and tamper proof way to select a random participant. <br>
    Following is a brief explanation: <br>
    <br>
Each Participant picks a number between 0 and 1. <br>
        The numbers are multiplied by the number of participants and rounded to a whole number (The number will be between 1 and the number of participants) <br>
        You then take the sum of the numbers and get the remainder after dividing by the number of participants. <br>
        The remainder is the participant that is selected. (remainder 0 is the last participant)
