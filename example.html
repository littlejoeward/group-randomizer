    <p> Each Participant (in this example there are three) picks a number between 0 and 1. <br>
        The numbers are multiplied by the number of participants and rounded to a whole number (The number will be between 1 and the number of participants) <br>
        You then take the sum of the numbers and get the remainder after dividing by the number of participants. <br>
        The remainder is the participant that is selected. (remainder 0 is the last participant) <br>
